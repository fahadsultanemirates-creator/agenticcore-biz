 * a number its checkout does not charge.
 *
 * WHAT THE DATABASE DOES AND DOES NOT KNOW. There is no services table.

 * and what it cost. That is lucky, and it means retiring a service is a

/**
 * The twelve AI-marketing services .biz used to sell.
 *
 * Archived, not deleted. Three reasons, and the first is the one that
 * matters: an order placed last month stored its service name as text,
 * and a customer looking at that order should still see what it was
 * rather than a blank. Second, an old link or bookmark can be answered
 * with "this is retired" instead of a 404. Third, deleting them would
 * make it impossible to tell a retired service from a typo.
 *
 * Nothing here is orderable. `activeServices` is what the site offers,
 * and it filters on status, so an archived entry cannot reach a card, a
 * dropdown, a checkout or Forge by accident.
 *
 * Several of these have a successor in the new catalog and say so, since
 * the common case is a customer asking what happened to the thing they
 * used to buy.
